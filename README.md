## NMEA 0183 Serial Integration for Home Assistant

![Smart Boat 0183 Serial Integration](.github/smart0183serial.png)

The **ha-smart0183serial** integration lets **Home Assistant** receive real-time **NMEA 0183** data via a direct USB-to-RS232/RS422 cable connection. This hard-wired method delivers a stable, interference-free data feed for monitoring wind, depth, speed, GPS, and other marine instruments directly in your dashboards. Perfect for **Raspberry Pi**-based central marine computers and boat automation projects where reliability is key.
